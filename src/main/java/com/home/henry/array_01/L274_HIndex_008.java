    /**
     * Java bucket sort O(n) solution with detail explanation
     * This type of problems always throw me off, but it just takes some getting used to. The idea behind it is some bucket sort mechanisms.
     * First, you may ask why bucket sort. Well, the h-index is defined as the number of papers with reference greater than the number.
     * So assume n is the total number of papers, if we have n+1 buckets, number from 0 to n,
     * then for any paper with reference corresponding to the index of the bucket, we increment the count for that bucket.
     * The only exception is that for any paper with larger number of reference than n, we put in the n-th bucket.
     * Then we iterate from the back to the front of the buckets, whenever the total count exceeds the index of the bucket,
     * meaning that we have the index number of papers that have reference greater than or equal to the index.
     * Which will be our h-index result. The reason to scan from the end of the array is that we are looking for the greatest h-index.
     * For example, given array [3,0,6,5,1], we have 6 buckets to contain how many papers have the corresponding index.
